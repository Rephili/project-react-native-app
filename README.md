# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

A mobile app made with React Native. The goal for this project was to learn some of the basics of React Native and the differences between React Native and React for the web, like how to use the sensors of the mobile, how to use external APIs and navigate from screen to screen. For this project I have implemented the shake sensor function, fetched data from an API and also created a button that allows the user to share the app.

## The problem

I started by fetching the images from the API and adding the Accelerometer so that the user gets another image when shaking the mobile. Then I added the share button and did some basic styling.
I was planning on implementing a Lottie animation and followed the Expo documentation, but unfortunately I didn't get it to work. If I had more time I might create a drawer navigator and maybe add the option to share a specific image. I might also continue working on the animation issue. I used styled components for the styling.

## View it live

I had some problems getting the expo commands to work, so the project can be found here as an Expo Snack:

I have tested it on iOS (iPhone SE).
